Within this unit we have used practical programming to create pieces of work from sound, images, and 3D graphics. This unit heavily used C++, JavaScript including other creative frameworks to complete weekly homework. Lecturers introduced me to many artists, but my inspiration came from artists like Katharina Brunner and Manolo Gamboa Naon as their work was closely connected to the weekly homework we completed. Manolo uses algorithmic tools to create his pieces. I was also influenced by the artists suggested by our lecturers however got more inspiration from the ones I found myself which helped to generate original creative works. My understanding of core programming skills grew through peer groups and constant weekly feedback when sending my fellow classmates my homework, this allowed me to fix any faults that I maybe couldnâ€™t do by myself and better my work through this feedback. I was able to develop an advance foundation to help tackle the rest of the course by using W3schools and other online resources provided, whilst doing independent study. In the first we look at understanding sound processing through the basics of digital audio and then from there making a continuous drone-based sound texture using oscillators (sound waves). You can store, recreate and manipulative audio information in a computer for example some characteristics of a sound wave like frequency and amplitude is converted into data through samples so the computer software can read it. In my code I used amplitude modulation. This is multiplying two oscillators together, I also used frequency modulation by using the output of a sinewave oscillator to control the frequency of another.

Further into the unit we explored images processing. When looking into creating 2D graphics I further developed Flores geometrici piece using the mouse to control the formation of the petals, I also affected the speed, direction, and size of the flowers. Using the rose curve algorithm, it allowed me to understand the basics of polar coordinates. I used the variable K to calculate the number of petals on the canvas. K was formed as an irreducible fraction which I learnt how to do using a section from a Wikipedia page based on rose mathematics. Wikipedia used a diagram to present me all the different possibilities of a flower using the variable K. After a few weeks in the unit, I learnt how to use if statements which I used in this so the direction of two of the flowers could be constantly moving. After the basic understanding of 2D graphics we then began to develop 3D graphics using THREE.JS to create a 3D world unfortunately I did struggle producing the 3D world using Three.js instead I used the accelerate editor to add basic shapes and 3D models to create a basic scene. Unfortunately, we used basic html to create whereas three.js is just JavaScript then we do basic geometry, you can make a box geometry to make a regular cuboid that gives width, height and depth which is similar which what I controlled on aframe.
